Command execution rules for MOVA project:

1. After every task, always generate exact shell commands needed to apply the changes.
   - Use macOS/Linux Bash syntax (compatible with zsh/bash).
   - Never skip commands.
   - Never leave them incomplete.

2. Output commands in a separate fenced block (```bash ... ```), so that the editor shows a [Run] button.

3. Do not execute commands automatically. 
   - Show them to the user.
   - The user decides when to press Run.

4. Commands must be minimal and deterministic.
   - No comments, no explanations.
   - One command per line.
   - Order them exactly as they should be executed.

5. Examples:
   ```bash
   make ctx-init
   make ctx-save TITLE="Step 3" TEXT="Add Makefile" TAGS="mova,cursor"
   git add Makefile
   git commit -m "feat(ctx): add Makefile targets"
